To do:
1 navigation view layout - done
2 setup navigation - done
3 ideas

Ideas:


cache system where verification of images by name(could use existing list), so no async loading 
ability to clear cache
logging system where if application errors, write it console cache to log, maybe use another app?

Notes:

for async stuff -> (meathod)get: Overloaded. Returns the result this task produced. If the task is not in a terminal state, a call to get will wait for the task to finish. This method does not return a value when called on a task with a result_type of void.

Systems:

how async doawnloading is done

0 Page loaded with no_image on by default

1 after page load async work
1a asset loc goes into async
1b assetloc is used to define image sotre location and list is generated of file created
1c list is returned and is used to determine which images are shown

2 hope to god it works
